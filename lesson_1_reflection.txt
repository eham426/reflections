How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you 
see the bug that was introduced?

You could compare working code to broken code, making the errors stand out.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By keeping a detailed history of the code, it will provide backups
for future changes. This way, changes can be implemented without fear
of breaking existing code, as backups exist.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when 
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You can keep the different commits separated more logically

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
 treat each file separately?

 Git focuses on code, where there are many instances of many files working together
 In google docs, you don't really need this kind of interrelation.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
 that could break something?

By having past versions of your code, you can experiment while knowing
 that if you happen to mess everything up, you can reset to an earlier
 versions.
