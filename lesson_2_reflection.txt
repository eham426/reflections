What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the repository. It needs to be done so commits can be stored in the .git directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is of stuff that's about to be committed, while the
	 working directory won't be affected.It lets you set up a customized
	  commit. You can pick and choose which files to commit to create a more logical checkpoint.
