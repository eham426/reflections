What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    It would be useful if you are about to go somewhere that has no internet and you want
    to have the most updated code to work with.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     When sharing work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The same reason you don't want commits to occur automatically, you want to make sure
    you are at a logical junction before pulling in changes that may interfere with what
    you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?
    Forks are for cloning a repository from someone else onto your github account.
    You would use this when using the original as a starting point to develop
    your own project along with other people.
    Cloning directly would be for when you want to use someone else's repository, but
    don't want your work to be on github.
    Branching is how you make changes on a project that is already local.
