When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     When sharing work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The same reason you don't want commits to occur automatically, you want to make sure
    you are at a logical junction before pulling in changes that may interfere with what
    you are currently working on.
